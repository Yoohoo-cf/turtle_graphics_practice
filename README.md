# Turtle Dot Painting Generator

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the `turtle` graphics module to generate a colorful dot painting in the style of Damien Hirst's famous dot artworks. The script relies on a pre-defined list of colors and arranges these colors into a grid of dots, creating a visually appealing pattern.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This script is compatible with Python 3.x versions. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official site:

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a zip file. Use the following command to clone it using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Yoohoo-cf/turtle_graphics_practice
```

## Script Features

Color Palette: The script uses a fixed set of RGB color tuples which are defined or extracted by colorgram at the beginning of the script. These colors were chosen to give a vibrant look similar to the palettes used in Hirst's dot paintings.

Dot Placement: The script generates a total of 100 dots arranged in a 10x10 grid. Each dot is spaced 50 pixels apart, and after completing a row of 10 dots, the turtle moves down to start the next row.

Turtle Graphics: The script uses the Turtle module for drawing, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphics using a "turtle" that can move around the screen and draw lines or dots.

## Dependencies

Python 3.x
colorgram.py
Turtle Module (comes standard with Python)
